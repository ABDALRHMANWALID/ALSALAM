                            <h2>Parliament Speaker: We will not pass amendments to the old rent except in the interest of everyone</h2>
                            <p>
                                Today, Monday, the plenary session of the House of Representatives, headed by Counselor Hanafi Jabali, witnessed the approval in total of the articles of a draft law regarding some procedures and dates for evacuating premises rented to legal persons for non-residential purposes, in light of the effects and economic repercussions of the new Corona virus, whose provisions apply to places rented to legal persons for non-residential purposes. A residential purpose, and its philosophy crystallizes in maintaining the economic and social stability of the Egyptian society, by regulating the implementation of the Supreme Constitutional Court’s ruling, which leads to the evacuation of premises rented to legal persons for use other than the residential purpose, provided that this is done in a manner that addresses the economic and social necessities represented in the inability to The current legal persons have to provide alternative places to the places they rent in light of the current economic crisis as a result of the repercussions of the spread of the emerging Corona virus pandemic.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Counselor Dr. Hanafi Jabali, Speaker of the House of Representatives, stressed that the draft law submitted by the government regarding some procedures and dates for evacuating the premises rented to legal persons for non-residential purposes in light of the effects and economic repercussions of the new Corona virus does not affect, from near or far, the ruling of the Supreme Constitutional Court issued to evacuate legal persons, It is not related to leasing to legal persons for the purpose of housing, nor is it related to leasing to natural persons other than for a residential purpose, such as shops that practice professions, crafts or industry, since these are subject to Law No. 6 of 1997 and its amendments.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Jabali explained that Law No. 6 of 1997 regulated the rental relationship for a natural person who practices a trade and profession and put an increase in the rent value, and that this law had previously been presented to the Constitutional Court, which decided that it does not contradict the constitution.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Jabali clarified that the draft law currently presented has nothing to do with the one who obtained a final judicial ruling, and the law before it does not apply, and it is not applied with no retroactive effect, as it is applied from the date of its implementation.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                He added that any person has the right to resort to the judiciary after the issuance of that law, because the right to litigate is guaranteed to everyone, and about the five-year period stipulated in the draft law, Jabali explained, that the draft law addresses some of the procedures that resulted from the Corona crisis, noting that this law It was issued to meet a case of necessity, and therefore the government’s discretion decided that a five-year period should be given to activate the law, based on what was announced by various health authorities globally and locally regarding the duration of the continuation of confronting the Corona crisis, and therefore the goal of the five-year period is to reassure everyone.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Jabali continued: There have been many cases since the Constitutional Court ruling was issued in 2019 to vacate these places, and there are many who resorted to the judiciary and obtained final rulings, and these rulings are respected, but the draft law has nothing to do with the ruling of the Supreme Constitutional Court, as this law is effective from the date of its implementation in accordance with Article The amendments contained in the amendments do not apply retroactively, and there is absolutely no problem with the delay in issuing this law since 2019.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Speaker of the House of Representatives said that after the issuance of this law and its entry into force, whoever wishes to resort to the judiciary, this is his constitutional right, and the draft law does not prevent resorting to the judiciary, as the judiciary is an independent authority that we respect, as we respect the executive authority.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The plenary session of the House of Representatives witnessed demands for the adoption of a draft law on “old rent”, which was commented on by Counselor Dr. Hanafi Jabali, saying that the Parliament will not pass any legislative amendments related to the old rent for a residential purpose except in the interest of everyone, saying: “We wish the best for everyone.” Egyptian citizens are owners and tenants, and we will not oppress anyone or allow that.”.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Jabali said that the old lease bill will come out in a balanced manner and will only be passed in a manner that achieves the general interest of all, especially the vigilant conscience of MPs.

                            </p>
                            <P>
                                Jabali added that the parliamentary committee, during its discussion of the old rental bill for a residential purpose, as soon as it is received, will conduct opinion polls and confrontations.
                            </P>
                            <P>
                                The members of the House of Representatives supported a draft law submitted by the government regarding the procedures and dates for evacuating the premises rented to legal persons for non-residential purposes in light of the effects and economic repercussions of the Corona virus, considering it an important initial step towards establishing an integrated balance for the relationship between the owner and the tenant in a way that protects and establishes the constitutional and legal rights of both parties. Taking into account the social dimension of the two sides of the brief relationship and without prejudice to the economic stability of society, the session also witnessed calls for action.
                            </P>
                            <p>
                                The first article of the draft law specifies the scope of application of the provisions of this law to the places leased to legal persons for non-residential purposes in accordance with the provisions of Laws No. 49 of 1977 regarding the lease and sale of places and the regulation of the relationship between the landlord and tenant, and 136 of 1981 regarding some provisions related to the rental and sale of places and the organization The relationship between the lessor and the lessee.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The parliament rejected the request of MP Marcel Samir, to amend Article One, with the exception of the headquarters of political parties and trade unions from applying the amendments, because they were unable to bear the financial burdens in the event of their expulsion.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Counselor Alaa Fouad, Minister of Parliamentary Affairs, said that failure to address these groups with the draft law will expose them to expulsion on the second day of implementing the law, because the contained amendments give them an opportunity to stay for 5 years.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Counselor Dr. Hanafi Jabali, Speaker of the House of Representatives, agreed with him, saying: Any exception will make the ruling of the Constitutional Court apply to the excluded groups.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The council’s approval to amend the name of the draft law came on the basis of a proposal by Representative Ashraf Rashad, representative of the parliamentary majority for the future of a homeland, during the plenary session today, and the government presented the draft law in the name of the procedures required to deal with the repercussions left by the emerging Corona virus.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Council also agreed to set a period for vacating the premises rented to legal persons for non-residential purposes, with the expiry of a period of 5 years from the date of enforcement of the law.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Article (2) of a draft law submitted by the government regarding the procedures and dates for evacuating premises rented to legal persons for non-residential purposes in light of the effects and economic repercussions of the emerging corona virus, stipulates that without prejudice to the other reasons for eviction set forth in Article (18) of Law No. 136 of 1981 The aforementioned, the eviction of the premises rented to legal persons for a purpose other than housing is in accordance with the provisions of Laws Nos. 49 of 1977 and 136 of 1981 referred to, with the expiry of a period of 5 years from the date of enforcement of the law, unless otherwise agreed upon.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The previous formulation came after the agreement between the government and the Council to replace the phrase regulating the evacuation of premises rented to legal persons for a purpose other than residential, to be by the expiry of a period of 5 years from the date the law came into force, instead of the text of the Parliamentary Committee, which was stipulated that it be within a period not exceeding five years from the date of work By law,” in light of the proposal of Representative Mahmoud Qassem in this regard.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Future Watan Party demanded that the text concluded by the Parliamentary Committee be preserved, especially since it was approved after lengthy discussions with the government, so that the Speaker of the Council clarified that the stipulation that the eviction should be within a period of 5 years means that eviction can be done after a year, and therefore the amendment must be made so as not to result in On the text the courts are full of cases.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After extensive and rich discussions, Representative Ashraf Rashad called on the government to formulate a court to which it adheres, especially as it will work to implement the legal article. Counselor Alaa El-Din Fouad, Minister of Parliamentary Affairs, demanded that the phrase “at the end of a period of 5 years from the date of the law’s implementation.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The matter was supported by the Speaker of Parliament, Counselor Hanafi Jabali, who confirmed that by returning to the rent laws, they speak of expiry and not within a period, so as not to issue problems before the courts.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Jabali pointed out that the government's philosophy in the draft law saw that the appropriate period for the repercussions of Corona is approximately 5 years, after which the conditions for the tenant would stabilize, noting that if the eviction was maintained within a period of 5 years, the philosophy of the draft law would be wasted.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Jabali noted that the law applies to everyone who was a legal person and names the virtual or imaginary person for this person, including hospitals, parties and unions.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The House of Representatives rejected parliamentary proposals to reduce the period of vacating places rented to legal persons for non-residential purposes, to be within a period of 3 years instead of 5 years, in light of what was presented by Representatives Hani Abaza, Reda Ghazi, Ahmed Al-Sharqawi.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Article (3) specified the rental value for the places specified in the scope of this law, as it stipulates that as of the date of enforcement of this law, the legal rental value of the rented places subject to the provisions of this law shall be five times the legal value in force, and it shall be increased annually and periodically by the last legal value due according to this law. The law increased by 15%, while Article 4 of the draft law obligates the tenant to vacate the leased place and return it to the owner or lessor - as the case may be - on the day following the expiry of the period set forth in Article (2) of the law, which does not exceed five years), and also authorized those Article For both the owner and the lessor - as the case may be - in the event the tenant refrains from eviction, they may ask the judge of temporary matters in the court in whose district the property is located to expel the person refraining from eviction, without prejudice to the right to compensation if necessary.
                            </p>

                                During the plenary session, Representative Hiyam Al-Tabbakh, a member of the House of Representatives for the Coordination of Youth of Parties and Politicians, announced her rejection of a draft law on procedures and dates for evacuating premises rented to legal persons for non-residential purposes, in light of the effects and economic repercussions of the Corona virus, during the plenary session of the House of Representatives today.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Meanwhile, Mohamed Abdelaziz, a member of the House of Representatives for the Coordination of Youth Parties and Politicians, confirmed that the ruling of the Supreme Constitutional Court was clear in the issuance of the first paragraph of Law No. 136 of 1981, and that the project presented for renting places for legal persons for non-residential purposes was a postponement of the court’s ruling.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Meanwhile, Representative Ahmed Ramzy, a member of the House of Representatives for the Coordination of Youth of Parties and Politicians, stressed that it is time to organize the relationship between the owner and the tenant in a way that restores balance to this relationship, which has become the current laws that regulate it unfair and unfair, declaring his approval in principle in his speech before the plenary session of the House of Representatives Today on a draft law submitted by the government regarding the procedures required to deal with the repercussions of the emerging corona virus, as an alternative to the previous one, regarding some provisions for renting places for legal persons for non-residential purposes.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                During his speech at the council’s plenary session today, Ramzy called for urgent legislative intervention that works to find a radical solution to this problem in a way that does not lead to injustice to either party to the rental relationship, whether they are owners or tenants, so that the right of ownership and its consequences are respected and in the same Time The social and economic dimension of some tenants is taken into consideration.
                            </p>
                            <p>
